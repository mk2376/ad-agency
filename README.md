## Setup

The following applications should be installed in order to run the Web3 Advertising Agency.

### Ganache

Ganache is a personal blockchain that allows developers to test and deploy Ethereum smart contracts in a local development environment Follow the quickstart guide [here](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/quickstart/).

### IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS allows users to store, share, and access files and data in a decentralized manner, without relying on a centralized server or storage system. Follow the quickstart guide [here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/server-infrastructure/#features). We are using Infura for this project.

### TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google for numerical computation and machine learning. It is designed to enable developers to build and train deep learning models quickly and easily, using a high-level API that abstracts away many of the lower-level details of neural network programming. Follow the quickstart guide [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#install).
